Statistical analysis into Darwin's Finches Birds Evolution

As an aspiring data scientist I've been following courses on DataCamp and have repeated some of the exercises on statistical learning below. The dataset is taken from Kaggle (available here: https://www.kaggle.com/crbelhekar619/darwins-finches-evolution-dataset?select=scandens_beak_depth_heredity.csv)

As a context, Finches are a group of birds that Darwin was observing on Galapagos islands. They are well known for their diversity in beak sizes. The dataset provides with beak depth and length measurements for year 1975 and year 2012.

My goal is to consolidate what I've learnt, put theory into (python) practice by statistically analysing the dataset of Finches beaks and visualise the insight to the audience.

Dataset is available in inch_beaks_1975_2012 dataset.
